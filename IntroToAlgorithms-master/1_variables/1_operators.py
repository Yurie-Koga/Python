# Boolean Operators
# Boolean (bool) is a type of value that can only be True or False

# 1. Comparison
# == : equality (equal)
print("3 == 4: ", 3 == 4)
# != : not equal to
print("3 != 4: ", 3 != 4)

# > : greater than
# < : less than
# >= : greater than or equal to
# <= : less than or equal to
print("3 > 4:  ", 3 > 4)
print("3 <= 3: ", 3 <= 3)

# This is 'chained comparison' (python only)
# Check (3 < x) and (x < 5) at the same time
x = 4
print(f"x = {x}, 3 < x < 5: {3 < x < 5}")

# A or B : either A or B has to be True, to return True
# A and B : both A and B have to be True, to return True
print("(3 != 3) or (4 == 4) : ", (3 != 3) or (4 == 4))  # True
print(f"x = {x}, (3 < x) and (x < 5) :  ", (3 < x) and (x < 5))

# Exercise
num = 10
# print((num > 1) and (num / 0 == 0))
print((num > 10) and (num / 0 == 0))
print((num > 1) or (num / 0 == 0))
print(not (num > 10) or (num / 0 == 0))
print(not True)  # False
print(not False)  # True
